``Painter.jl`` is a julia implementation of PAINTER: Polychromatic
opticAl INTErferometric Reconstruction software described in [1]_ and [2]_.

PAINTER was developped at Laboratoire J.-L. Lagrange, Université de Nice
Sophia, CNRS, Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, by `Antony
Schutz <http://www.antonyschutz.com>`_ and `André
Ferrari <https://www-n.oca.eu/aferrari>`_.

----------

The PAINTER algorithm is described in [1]_. The original MATLAB code is
available `here <https://www-n.oca.eu/aferrari/painter/>`_ but the use
of ``Painter.jl`` is highly recommended.
`Painter.jl <https://github.com/andferrari/Painter.jl>`_ implements
an accelerated version of PAINTER described in [2]_.
